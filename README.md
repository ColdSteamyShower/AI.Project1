I ran into a very strange issue while finishing up my code. I was originally using
vectors to store the state space tree until I switched to linked lists. This created
an issue where I was not able to remove objects correctly, and found a work-around
using iterators. I'm aware that a linked list is not the most effective way to do
this assignment, but it worked as a last-minute settlement.
